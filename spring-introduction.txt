Spring :-
 1. It is open source Java Framework
 2. We can develop Standalone & Enterprise application
 3. Initial Release in 2003
 4. First production release in 2004 version 1.0
 5. It is developed by "Rod Jhonson"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of Spring :-
 1. Modular and lightweight :- Spring follow modular architecture, allowing developers to use only
    the components they need, making application more lightweight and easier to maintain.
 2. Flexible configuration :-
     Support multiple configuration options
     XML Configuration
     Java based Configuration
     Annotation based configuration
 3. DI :- Spring support DI, which simplifies the management of component dependecies, making
    code more testable and adaptable to changes.
 4. Simplified database access :- Spring JDBC and Object Relational Mapping support 
    simplifies database access, reduces boilerplate code and improve data access efficiency.
 5. Security :- Spring security provides robust framework for implementing authentication and
    authorization, making it easier to secure web application and services.
 6. Scalability :- Spring application can be designed for scalability and can easily integrate with
    cloud native techology and microserives architecuture.
 7. Open source.

 Core component Of Spring :-
  Spring Container ;- It is core component of Spring. It is responsible to hanle Spring App.
  Responsibility :-
   1. Manage Bean Objects
   2. Manage Bean Life Cycle.
   3. Dependency Injection
   4. Provide AOP Support
   5. Transaction Management
   6. I18N [Internationalization]
      etc.
-----------------------------------------------------
Types of Container :-
 1. BeanFactory :- Outdated , Out of fashion
 2. ApplicationContext[Interface]  :- Current Trend
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Some Important Annotation :-
 1️⃣ @Bean

Declares a method as a bean producer.

The object returned is registered in the Spring context.

Used in Java configuration (@Configuration) for manual bean creation.

2️⃣ @Configuration

Marks a class as a Spring configuration class (replacement for XML).

Spring scans this class for @Bean methods and registers them in the context.

3️⃣ @ComponentScan

Tells Spring which packages to scan for components annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller.

Enables automatic detection of beans without manual @Bean creation.

4️⃣ @Repository

Marks a class as DAO / data access layer.

Spring registers it as a bean automatically.

Enables exception translation, converting JDBC exceptions to Spring’s DataAccessException.

5️⃣ @EnableTransactionManagement

Enables annotation-driven transaction management in Spring.

Required for @Transactional to work.

6️⃣ @Transactional

Marks a method or class as transactional.

Spring automatically handles commit and rollback.

Best practice: Apply on service layer, not DAO.

Rollback occurs automatically for RuntimeException; for checked exceptions, specify rollbackFor.

7️⃣ @Service

Marks a class as a service / business layer component.

Detected by component scanning.

Typically contains business logic and transaction management.

8️⃣ @Autowired

Marks a field, constructor, or setter for automatic dependency injection.

Rules:

Field injection: easy but less testable.

Constructor injection: preferred, especially for final fields.

Setter injection: optional if using default constructor.

If multiple constructors exist, annotate one constructor with @Autowired.
