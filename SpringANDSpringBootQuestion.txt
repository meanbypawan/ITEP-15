You can use this for 2–8 years experience interviews.

🔷 PART 1: CORE SPRING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
🔹 Basic Spring Questions
1. What is Spring Framework?

Lightweight Java framework

Provides IoC, DI, AOP, MVC, Transaction Management

Reduces boilerplate code

2. What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?

Control of object creation is transferred from developer to Spring container

Example:

@Autowired
UserService userService;

3. What is Dependency Injection?

Injecting dependencies instead of creating them manually

Types:

Constructor injection ✅ (recommended)

Setter injection

Field injection ❌

4. Difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
BeanFactory	ApplicationContext
Lazy loading	Eager loading
Lightweight	Feature-rich
No event support	Event support
5. What is a Spring Bean?

An object managed by Spring container

6. Bean Scopes in Spring?

singleton (default)

prototype

request

session

application

7. What is @Component, @Service, @Repository?

@Component → generic

@Service → business logic

@Repository → DAO + exception translation

🔹 Intermediate Spring Questions
8. What is AOP?

Aspect Oriented Programming

Separates cross-cutting concerns

Examples:

Logging

Security

Transactions

9. What is @Transactional?

Manages database transactions

Rollback on RuntimeException by default

10. Difference between @Autowired and @Qualifier?

@Autowired → inject by type

@Qualifier → resolve ambiguity

11. Spring MVC Request Flow?
Client → DispatcherServlet → Controller → Service → DAO → DB

🔷 PART 2: SPRING BOOT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
🔹 Basic Spring Boot Questions
12. What is Spring Boot?

Built on top of Spring

Auto-configuration

Embedded server

Opinionated defaults

13. Difference between Spring and Spring Boot?
Spring	Spring Boot
Manual config	Auto-config
External server	Embedded server
XML heavy	Annotation based
14. What is Auto-Configuration?

Spring Boot automatically configures beans based on:

Classpath

Properties

Dependencies

15. What is @SpringBootApplication?

Combination of:

@Configuration

@EnableAutoConfiguration

@ComponentScan

16. What are Starters?

Predefined dependency bundles
Example:

spring-boot-starter-web
spring-boot-starter-security

17. What is application.properties / yml?

Central configuration file

Environment specific configs supported

🔹 Advanced Spring Boot Questions
18. What is Actuator?

Provides production-ready endpoints

Examples:

/actuator/health
/actuator/metrics

19. How does Spring Boot work internally?

Reads classpath

Loads auto-configuration

Creates beans conditionally

20. What is Profiles?

Environment-based configuration

spring.profiles.active=dev

🔷 PART 3: MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
🔹 Basics
21. What is Monolithic Architecture?

Single codebase

Single deployment

All modules tightly coupled

22. Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

Simple development

Easy deployment

Less infrastructure

23. Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

Hard to scale

Single point of failure

Slow deployment

Tight coupling

24. When should monolith be used?

Small teams

Small applications

Early startup phase

25. Monolith vs Microservices?
Monolith	Microservices
Single deploy	Multiple deploys
Tight coupling	Loose coupling
Scale whole app	Scale per service
🔷 PART 4: MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
🔹 Basics
26. What are Microservices?

Small, independent services

Own database

Communicate via REST / messaging

27. Key Characteristics of Microservices

Decentralized data

Independent deployment

Fault isolation

28. Advantages of Microservices

Scalability

Faster deployment

Technology flexibility

29. Challenges of Microservices

Distributed systems complexity

Network latency

Data consistency

Monitoring & security

🔹 Microservices Design Questions
30. What is API Gateway?

Single entry point

Routing

Authentication & Authorization

Rate limiting

31. What is Service Discovery?

Dynamic location of services

Examples:

Eureka

Consul

Kubernetes DNS

32. What is Circuit Breaker?

Prevents cascading failures

Example:

Resilience4j

33. What is Config Server?

Centralized configuration

Dynamic refresh

34. Database per Microservice – why?

Loose coupling

Independent scaling

Avoids shared DB issues

🔹 Security & Communication
35. How is security handled in microservices?

JWT / OAuth2

API Gateway security

mTLS (advanced)

36. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication?

REST → sync

Kafka / RabbitMQ → async

37. What is Event-Driven Architecture?

Services react to events

Loose coupling

🔹 Real-Time / Practical Questions
38. How do you handle distributed transactions?

Saga pattern

Eventual consistency

39. How do you monitor microservices?

Centralized logging

Metrics

Distributed tracing

40. Monolith to Microservice migration strategy?

Strangler pattern

Gradual extraction
